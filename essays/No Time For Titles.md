It's now two weeks into the semester and I'm still learning to adjust to the pacing of the schedule, so I find myself without enough time to create a proper introduction for this essay, so lets jump right into my thoughts about the experiences.

I think Javascript is a fine language to start learning from. Javascript is not strict about what you can assign to a variable. If abused it could lead to some pretty difficult to comprehend code, however, following the style guides should prevent that. Its flexibility allows students to focus more on coding a solution to a problem rather than getting bogged down on the particulars of some language's type requirements. It's a language that can be found on any computing device so it must be in demand and useful to know.

I used javascript quite a bit, 3-4 years ago, modifying code written by seasoned veterans. I thought I'd seen it all, however, everything in ES6 was new to me. Which is a reminder of what makes this industry so challenging-- that your effective knowledge can have a relatively short shelf life, If you're not willing to spend your free time keeping up with the rapid pace of changes common in the tech industry you can easily find your skills or knowledge outdated.

This semester is my first exposure to Athletic Software Engineering(ASE). ASE is much more fast paced with many more daily tasks due than any other class I've experienced at UH. It's a bit of a shock, however, it seems doable. That being the case, I can't deny that ASE is an effective way to cram more learning and experiences in a semester.

WODS or Workout of the Days have their pros and cons for me, for example, Following the instruction to watch the video after the first unsuccessful try rather than immediately reattempting to solve would leave me unsatisfied. I want to develop skills that help me produce solutions quickly. Watching the solution immediately denies me the second chance to work out the process of solving a problem myself. However, this also had the affect of making me eager to take on the next WOD for the challenge of solving a new unknown problem. So, it may be arguable whether or not reattempting to solve the WOD yourself is useful, as the instructor says you can reach a point of diminishing returns when spending a long time solving a problem, increasing motivation to take and beat the next WOD is clearly a good thing.

In closing I'll say this about this style of learning it is indeed stressful, as I am commonly catching myself relaxing after school then realizing, "Oh, shoot, I have something due tonight!" Also I wouldn't say it's enjoyable either, however, I do look forward to the sense of accomplishment once it's all over and done. It will take a bit of getting used to the pacing but I do think it will be an effective technique because I feel applying knowledge effectively is the best for learning and this teaching technique crams more of those opportunities as possible in the short span of time we have in a semester. 

Sincerely,
Robert
